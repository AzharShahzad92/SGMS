# SGMS
This project is a prototype implementation of a Study Group Management Tool for the WorkTogether event organized by the student representatives of the Faculty of Computer Science at TU Chemnitz. The tool is designed to simplify the process of forming and managing study groups for collaborative learning sessions.

# Project Goals
The main goal is to assist students in finding and managing suitable study groups during WorkTogether sessions. The platform provides both administrative (FSR:IF) and student interfaces, ensuring efficient session creation, visibility control, group organization, and real-time participation tracking.

  PL/pgSQL for implementing database logic
  Backend: PHP
  Frontend: Html, CSS, Javascript
